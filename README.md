<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About
<img src="Screenshots/0.png" width="200"/> 

<p> As someone who cycles everyday when possible, I use the popular fitness app 'Strava' to help with tracking and its great! With that said, recently I have wanted view my progress against friends/family. Strava being a business who has to make their subscription model sustainable, removed the leaderboard feature for the free tier in 2020. This got me thinking, why don't I just make my own version.<p>

<p>Introducing 'Push Forward' (name subject to change), an app that plans to do everything Strava does but for free!</p>
